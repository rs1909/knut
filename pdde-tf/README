For istallation instructions read the manual (manual.pdf),
which can be found in the doc/ subdirectory.

Known issues:
- On Windows(TM) under MinGW32 the Neimark-Sacker bifurcation continuation 
  fails after some steps, which might be related to gcc 4.0.2 or the 
  ATLAS package. (It does not happen under Linux.)
- Fold bifurcation continuation in the traffic model is a difficult problem,
  therefore some tweaking will be necessary to make it work.
- There are lots of fold bifurcations in the Mackey-Glass equation, some of
  them are easy to compute, others are difficult. The software might stop at
  certain parameter values but this can be overcome by some manual
  intervention.
- Equations with rotational symmetries can be analyzed only with some
  limitations. The fold bifurcation continuation only works if the
  period-length is not a free parameter. (If somebody knows why, let me
  know, please!)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The program was tested on:

  Linux x86, GNU gcc 3.4.2, 3.4.3, 3.4.4 (Fedora Core 3 and Debian 3.0)
  Linux x86, GNU gcc 4.0.0, 4.0.1 (Fedora Core 4)
  Linux x86, GNU gcc 3.3.5 (SuSE 9.3 and Debian 3.1)
  Linux x86, Intel C,C++ v8.1, (Fedora Core 4)
   with the following configure options:

    ./configure --prefix=/home/szalai/pdde-cont/ "CC=icc" "CFLAGS=-xB -O2 -g"
    "CXX=icpc" "CXXFLAGS=-cxxlib-icc -xB -O2 -g"

   The `-cxxlib-icc' is necessary, because icc v8.1 was not compatible with
   the installed gcc 4.0.2. This option can be safely removed when 
   gcc v3.x.y is installed. The `-xB' is for the Pentium-M processor, 
   so it migh not be appropriate for other processors.

  Windows XP, mingw32, GNU gcc 3.4.2
  Sun Solaris 9, UltraSparc IIIi, gcc 3.3.2
  Sun Solaris 9, UltraSparc IIIi, Sun C, C++ 5.7 2005/01/07
   with the following configure options:

    ./configure --prefix=/home/szalai/pdde-cont/ "CC=cc" "CXX=CC"

  gcc 2.x.y __CANNOT__ compile the program because it has insufficient template
  support.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Future versions:
  Some constants will be added to the onstants file', so that the current
  files will not be compatible with the future versions. After the release of
  version 1.0 the file structures will not change. Till then be cautious and
  check the manual frequently.
