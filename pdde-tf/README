For istallation instructions first compile and then read the manual (manual.tex) in the doc/
subdirectory using the following
commands:
  pdflatex manual
  bibtex manual
  pdflatex manual
  pdflatex manual
This will produce the file "manual.pdf" that can be printed.

Known issues:
- Fold bifurcation continuation in the traffic model is a difficult problem,
  therefore some tweaking will be necessary to make it work.
- There are lots of fold bifurcations in the Mackey-Glass equation, some of
  them are easy to compute, others are difficult. The software might stop at
  certain parameter values but this can be overcome by some manual
  intervention.
- The fold bifurcation in the laser example is rather stiff and it can be
  continued if the period-length is not a free parameter. Apparently this
  continuation works with other symmetric equations reasonably well.
