-2. Create new characteristic matrix for fold bifurcation in the case of
    eqautions with symmetry.

-1. Give a method to supply which components of the solution are symmetric. 
    Currently it is hardcoded like in DDE-BIFTOOL. 

0.  Use overloaded operators to do matrix operations in a nicer manner. 
    add ranges for matrix multiplications like
      b(rng(12,23)) = A(rng(1,end,2,end)) * c(rng(4,end))
                      + 2.0*d(rng(12,23));
1.  Then change all the handwritten multiplications to this format

2.  Binary output format to save space. Preferably a .mat file for
    compatibility with matlab

3.  GUI to respect all the constants in the constants file 
    A plotting widget to display the solution, and the branch. And also
    plotting the content of an existing output file.
