- HyperMatrix::Check( HyperVector& X, HyperVector& F )
     the references maybe buggy with some compilers ( gcc 2.95.4 )

- create new characteristic matrix for fold bifurcation in the case of
eqautions with symmetry.

- give a method to supply which components of the solution are symmetric. 
Currently it is hardcoded like in DDE-BIFTOOL. 

0. use overloaded operators to do matrix operations in a nicer manner. 
   (not urgent)
1. using blas for matrix multiplications (not urgent)
2. the same for sparse matrix multiplication (not urgent)
