BUGS:
No bugs were reported, yet.

The program was tested on:

Linux x86, gcc 3.4.2, 3.4.3, 3.4.4 (Fedora Core 3 and Debian 3.0)
Linux x86, gcc 4.0.0, 4.0.1 (Fedora Core 4)
SuSE 9.3

Although gcc 4.0 can compile the software, it is not recommended to use it.
At the time of writing gcc 3.4.4 gave the best result.

With gcc 4.0 the cblas_idamax routine is buggy, but not the fortran routine,
which wraps the same ATLAS routine, so the problem is in the compiler.

gcc 2.95 cannot compile the software. However gcc 3.x.y should work,
especially starting from v3.3.x.

Sun Solaris 5.9 sun4u does not work because "long int lrint( double )" is missing from
its math library. If you know any function which rounds a double to its
closest integer and which does not depend on the actual rounding direction,
please report to me.
I haven't tried Solaris 10, which is promised to be compatible with Linux.
Also I could not make it work under MinGW on MS Windows, because the POSIX
dlfcn.h is missing (for loading plugins.)
