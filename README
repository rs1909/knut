For istallation instructions read the manual (manual.pdf),
which can be found in the doc/ subdirectory.

Future versions:
Some constants will be added to the `constants file', so that the current files
will not be compatible with the future versions. After the release of
version 1.0 the file structures will not change. Till then be cautious and
check the manual frequently.

BUGS:
  HyperMatrix::Check( HyperVector& X, HyperVector& F )
  the references maybe buggy with some compilers ( gcc 2.95.4 )
  Note that this function is not used, so it may cause trouble only during
  compilation phase.

The program was tested on:

Linux x86, gcc 3.4.2, 3.4.3, 3.4.4 (Fedora Core 3 and Debian 3.0)
Linux x86, gcc 4.0.0, 4.0.1 (Fedora Core 4)
SuSE 9.3

Sun Solaris 5.9 sun4u does not work because "long int lrint( double )" is missing from
its math library. If you know any function which rounds a double to its
closest integer and which does not depend on the actual rounding direction,
please report to me.
I haven't tried Solaris 10, which is promised to be compatible with Linux.
Also I could not make it work under MinGW on MS Windows, because the POSIX
dlfcn.h is missing (for loading plugins.)
