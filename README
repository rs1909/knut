The program was tested on:

  Linux x86, GNU gcc 3.4.2, 3.4.3, 3.4.4 (Fedora Core 3 and Debian 3.0)
  Linux x86, GNU gcc 4.0.0, 4.0.1 (Fedora Core 4)
  Linux x86, GNU gcc 3.3.5 (SuSE 9.3 and Debian 3.1)
  Linux x86, Intel C,C++ v8.1, (Fedora Core 4)
   with the following configure options:

    ./configure --prefix=/home/szalai/pdde-cont/ "CC=icc" "CFLAGS=-xB -O2 -g"
    "CXX=icpc" "CXXFLAGS=-cxxlib-icc -xB -O2 -g"

   The `-cxxlib-icc' is necessary, because icc v8.1 was not compatible with
   the installed gcc 4.0.2. This option can be safely removed when 
   gcc v3.x.y is installed. The `-xB' flag correponds to the Pentium-M
   processor, so it migh not be appropriate for other processors.

  Windows XP, mingw32, GNU gcc 3.4.2
  Sun Solaris 9, UltraSparc IIIi, gcc 3.3.2
  Sun Solaris 9, UltraSparc IIIi, Sun C, C++ 5.7 2005/01/07
   with the following configure options:

    ./configure --prefix=/home/szalai/pdde-cont/ "CC=cc" "CXX=CC"

  gcc 2.x.y __CANNOT__ compile the program because it has insufficient template
  support.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BUGS:
  There are some unsused variables as function arguments, which will be
  removed in a future release and now they are producing warning messages.
  This does not affect anything, just the beauty of the compile process.

Future versions:
  Some constants will be added to the onstants file', so that the current
  files will not be compatible with the future versions. After the release of
  version 1.0 the file structures will not change. Till then be cautious and
  check the manual frequently.
