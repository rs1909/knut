In 0.9.14
 - The torus continuation is working again, but it is still experimental.
 - there is a demo in demo/milloneup/ which uses the torus continuation:
   make test; make test-tr
 - loading of system definition sys-<>.so is improved. It can load the
   shared object from the current directory, so no environment variable
   needs to be set up. Also 'pcompile' is now set up using the configure
   script, which includes the absolute installation path into the script to
   look for header files. It also affects (simplifies) the installation 
   process, see the manual.
 

In 0.9.12
 - the non functioning fold computation routine with symmetries is removed
 - some minor bug fixes: derivatives with respect to parameters 
   should be correct in ncolloc.cpp
 - correction of the tangent vector after each iteretion in Point::Continue()
 - worked out exmamples are in the demo directory:
     glass          - make test
     traffic        - make test1 test2 test3 test4 test5
     turn           - make test
     laser          - make test
     milloneup      - make test
   the other exmaples are not testable yet
    
In 0.9.10
 - some initial work on fold in autonomous equations with symmetry.
   The 2 dim kernel space of the characteristic matrix can be deduced 
   directly form the solution x(t) and x'(t) respectively. The derivatives
   should be recomputed, because it seems to be buggy.

In 0.9.9
 - new parameters in the constants file, STAB and NMAT
   for details see the manual.
 - continuation with delays larger than the period. src/ncolloc.cpp 
   was modified heavily
 - new stability computation algorithm
   
In 0.9.6
 - support for equations with rotational symmetry. This is a second phase 
   condition
