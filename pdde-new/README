For istallation instructions read the manual (manual.pdf),
which can be found in the doc/ subdirectory.

Known issues:
- On Windows(TM) under MinGW32 the Neimark-Sacker bifurcation continuation 
  fails after some steps, which might be related to gcc 4.0.2 or the 
  ATLAS package. (It does not happen under Linux.)
- Fold bifurcation continuation in the traffic model is a difficult problem,
  therefore some tweaking will be necessary to make it work.
- There are lots of fold bifurcations in the Mackey-Glass equation, some of
  them are easy to compute, others are difficult. The software might stop at
  certain parameter values but this can be overcome by some manual
  intervention.
- Equations with rotational symmetries can be analyzed only with some
  limitations. The fold bifurcation continuation only works if the
  period-length is not a free parameter. (If somebody knows why, let me
  know, please!)
